/**
 * Two properties that were silently unenforced on the public widget surface.
 *
 * 1. `getOrgByWidgetToken` filtered on token and expiry but never on
 *    `deleted_at`, so a customer who deleted their account kept a live widget
 *    for the entire 30-day purge grace period — still answering from their
 *    knowledge base, still spending against their AI provider, still writing
 *    rows into an org marked for deletion. `softDeleteOrg` is documented as
 *    revoking access the moment it is set, and auth.ts enforces exactly that
 *    for every authenticated path; the widget is unauthenticated, so nothing
 *    was applying it here.
 *
 * 2. `saveWidgetLead` deduped with `onConflictDoNothing`, but `widget_leads`
 *    had no unique constraint for it to conflict on — the only unique column
 *    was the serial primary key, which never collides. The dedupe was a no-op
 *    on a public write endpoint.
 *
 * The predicate case is asserted against compiled SQL rather than a returned
 * row, because the filtering happens in Postgres: a fake driver returning
 * whatever it is handed would pass even with the predicate removed.
