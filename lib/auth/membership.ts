 * issued once and then re-signed with a fresh expiry on every session read, so
 * anything that revokes access after issuance — the org being soft-deleted, or
 * the user's membership being removed — is invisible to the token indefinitely
 * while the person keeps using the app. Deletion was already handled this way;
 * membership was not, which meant removing a member did not actually end their
 * access to the org.
 *
 * Returns a status for the caller to map onto a response, so the routing and
 * redirect decisions stay in the auth config and the data question stays here.
 * Both ids are validated rather than defaulted: this claim decides which
 * tenant's data every downstream query sees, and substituting a fallback org
 * for a session that never named one is precisely the failure this guards.
