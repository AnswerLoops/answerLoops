// Reported bug: importing a site that yields 0 pages (e.g. an unreachable
// domain, a waitlist/login gate, or robots.txt blocking the crawler) showed
// "Imported 0 articles from 0 pages." in green — the same success color as a
// real import. The color logic only branched on `incomplete`, never on
// whether anything was actually created. Same bug existed in the single-file
// upload status message. Source-shape assertions against the internal
// (non-exported) FileUploadSection/UrlIngestSection functions in
// app/(dashboard)/kb/page.tsx — matches this repo's convention for
// UI-logic-in-page-component cases (see tests/unit/billing-limit-warning.test.ts).
