/**
 * The per-request org gate (`resolveOrgAccess`, wired into auth.ts's
 * `authorized` callback).
 *
 * Two things can revoke access after a token has been issued: the org being
 * soft-deleted, and the user's membership being removed. Neither can reach a
 * JWT that already exists, and the token is re-signed with a fresh expiry on
 * every session read, so anything cached in the session keeps granting access
 * indefinitely while the person keeps using the app. Deletion was already
 * resolved live; membership was not — so removing a member did not end their
 * access to the org.
 *
 * These tests drive the resolver against a fake driver and assert on the
 * decision it returns, plus the shape of the single query it issues.
