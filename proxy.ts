  // nothing to cache. The pages excluded here are prerendered and need no
  // session check, so excluding them is what lets them be cached at the edge.
  // `/` and `/pricing` stay matched (they still resolve a session for their own
  // logic); `/api/*`, `/dashboard/*`, the auth pages, and the not-yet-launched
  // intent pages (/architecture, /support-*, /self-*, /mcp-support-agents,
  // /discord-github-support, /open-source-support) all stay matched too.
