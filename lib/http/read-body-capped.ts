/**
 * Reads a request body while counting actual bytes, aborting as soon as the
 * cap is crossed. Do not simplify this to `req.text()` plus a length check:
 * that buffers the whole body before the check can run, and a string `.length`
 * counts UTF-16 code units rather than bytes, so the cap would not hold.
 * Returns null when the cap is exceeded.
 *
 * Shared by every public, pre-auth POST endpoint (MCP, Agent API, widget) so
 * the limit stays identical across them.
 *
 * Takes anything with a body — NextRequest and plain Request both qualify.
