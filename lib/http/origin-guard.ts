/**
 * Verifies a request actually passed through our edge/CDN proxy before any
 * code trusts the proxy-supplied client-IP header (see lib/http/client-ip.ts).
 * That header is only spoof-proof if the origin is unreachable except through
 * the edge proxy — if the origin's address is reachable directly, any caller
 * can set the header themselves and mint a fresh rate-limit bucket per
 * request, defeating the per-IP limiter on every public pre-auth POST route
 * (MCP, Agent API, widget chat).
 *
 * Mitigation: a rule on the edge proxy (most CDNs offer a "modify request
 * header" feature) adds a static header carrying this secret on every request
 * it forwards to the origin. A request that reaches the origin without it did
 * not come through the edge and is rejected outright — softening to a
 * fallback IP source would still let the caller dodge the edge's WAF/DDoS
 * layer entirely, not just spoof the IP.
 *
 * Unenforced (passes everything through) until ORIGIN_VERIFY_SECRET is set,
 * so this is safe to deploy before the edge-side rule exists and safe for
 * local dev / staging with no edge proxy in front at all.
