/**
 * Guardrail for a real production bug: `hardPurgeOrg` deletes org data table
 * by table, by hand. Three tables (`email_domains`, `email_oauth_connections`,
 * `org_feature_flags`) were added to the schema over time and never wired into
 * it. Because every one of them declares `org_id ... REFERENCES orgs(id)` with
 * no `ON DELETE` clause, Postgres defaults the constraint to NO ACTION — so
 * `tx.delete(orgs)` raised a foreign-key violation, and since the whole purge
 * is one transaction, *nothing* was deleted. The sweep in bot/index.ts catches
 * and logs that failure per-org and retries on the next pass, so it never
 * surfaced: affected orgs simply stayed soft-deleted forever, with
 * `email_oauth_connections` still holding live encrypted mailbox refresh
 * tokens for a customer who had asked to be deleted.
 *
 * The only prior guard was `expect(deleteCalls.length).toBeGreaterThan(15)`
 * against an actual 27 — a floor that could never trip.
 *
 * This test derives the expected table list from the schema itself, so adding
 * an org-scoped table forces a deliberate decision: wire it into the purge, or
 * add it to EXEMPT below with a reason.
