/**
 * The single junction between authenticating and being allowed into the
 * product. Every path redirects except the post-checkout wait.
 *
 * Three kinds of visitor arrive:
 *
 * - **Mid-signup**, having picked a plan and just finished OAuth. Sent straight
 *   to Stripe. No interstitial — they already chose, and a "click to continue"
 *   page is only somewhere to abandon.
 *
 * - **Back from a completed checkout** (`?checkout=success`). Waits briefly for
 *   the webhook, then into the product. This is why the page is exempt from the
 *   access gate: at this moment they have paid but the row may not exist yet.
 *
 * - **Turned away by the gate** — abandoned checkout earlier, cancelled, or a
 *   lapsed trial. No plan to resume, so back to the public pricing page to
 *   choose one. Bouncing them into checkout for a plan they never selected
 *   would be presumptuous.
