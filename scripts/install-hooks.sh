#!/bin/sh
# Installs the repo's git hooks into .git/hooks.
#
# .git/hooks is not version-controlled, so a hook written there protects one
# machine and silently does nothing for anyone else — including after a fresh
# clone of this repo. Keeping the hook bodies here and copying them in makes the
# wiring reviewable and reproducible.
#
# Runs automatically via the `prepare` script on `pnpm install`. To run it by
# hand:  sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
#
# Two hooks, because git passes different things to each:
#
#   pre-commit  — staged additions, secret scan, tests. Receives no arguments.
#   commit-msg  — the commit message, which git passes as $1. This is the only
#                 hook that can see the message at all; a message check wired
#                 into pre-commit reads an empty "$1" and silently passes
#                 everything, which is exactly what happened here before.
#
# Everything between the managed markers is owned by this script and replaced
# wholesale on re-run. Anything outside them is left alone, so a pre-existing
# hook is preserved.
